### I didn't realize that the composer, John Oestmann, included an explainer video with his code when I started my analysis. Once discovered: I deliberately chose to not watch/reference the video at all during the creation of my analysis (I wanted to solve the puzzle on my own), but it felt wrong to not mention it's existence.
