## Python Reading Observations

### Chapter 1
Know: I knew that many programming languages, if not all, categorize different elements into classes
Didn’t: I didn’t know that there were multiple versions of Python. I also didn’t know that ** would be used for exponents rather than the carrot.

### Chapter 3
Know: I knew function headers had to end with a colon.
Didn’t: I didn’t know python had groups of functions stored in modules/what a module was.

### Chapter 5
Know: I knew python read all nonzero numbers as true. I also knew functions could call themselves.
Didn’t: I didn’t know Python had a recursion depth/ stopped feedback loops from happening. I also didn’t know about \n, or new line.
