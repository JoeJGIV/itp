### Midterm Phase 1 Documentation
This step of the midterm was extremely easy and self explanatory. I had originally sketched a different smiley face in class, but I decided to change up the final draft a bit: adding a triangle nose and using an arc for the mouth instead of the two lines I drew in class. In total I'll need 5 shapes for phase 2: a circle, 2 ellipses, a triangle, and an arc for the mouth.
