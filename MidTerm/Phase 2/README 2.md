### Midterm Phase 2 Documentation
This next phase of the midterm didn't provide much of a challange thankfully, and was easy to get running once I looked at the references for the primitive shapes I needed to use.
I first began by adjusting to a 200 by 200 canvas. This was for no particular reason outside of just obtaining a bigger work area.
Once the setup was complete I began by drawing the cricle, and placing it in the center of the canvas.
I then moved to drawing the arc for the mouth. The start and stop points were a challange to dial in, but I got a good result after some tinkering.
After the mouth I then drew in the ellipses for the eyes. Once I found a size I liked I postioned the first eye how I liked, then copied the size and made sure the coordinates between the ellipses were symmetrical.
After the eyes were done I added my final shape: the triangle nose, which took some tinkering to avoid making a clone of the Jack in the Box logo. The triangle was extremely easy to manipulate.
Overall this phase was still really easy, with the most amount of time being spent on fine tuning my arc.
