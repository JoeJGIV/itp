## Challanges Faced
Our main challange as a croup was encorporating our CSS file into our webiste after most of the heavy lifting was completed. We had originally set up the CSS file like an html file, but then discovered this was a syntax error. We only had to delete our unnecessary headers to achieve our desired website theme. There were no other major challanges, outside of waiting for the refresh time for our images to populate the website.

## How I Contributed
I think I did a good amount of work for this project. After Ruben layed the ground work I coded in our bios, header, and quote. I also typed out my own bio. While Ruben and Borys worked on the CSS section of our site I created some custom music to use for the imaginary band we created. I sampled several pieces from youtube to create something truly more than the sum of its parts.

## Assesment of the Group Members
Besides myself my other group members also did some heavy lifting. Borys found many of the images we used while Ruben began our coding process. Once Ruben and I traded off Borys then moved to working on CSS while Ruben worked on his bio. Overall I think the work was divded evenly and farily. We finished the assignment, and had plenty of time to add some humor to our project.
