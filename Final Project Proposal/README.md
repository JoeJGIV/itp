# The Project's Title
The project's title will likely be heavily influenced by what sounds I can achieve in Supercollider. The nature of the composition will likely shift depending on the implementation of effects, especially reverb.

# Basic Summary
My project will consist of creating an original composition within Supercollider.

# Further Details
My project will be a composition totaling around 4 minutes in length. The piece will utilize Supercolliders sound sources for instrumentation. It will have multiple contrasting sections, with notable timbral differences. Audio effects such as delay and reverb will be created/coded during the writing process, and implemented within the final composition in conjunction with the prior mentioned sound sources.

# The Good Ending
An okay result would be if the song ends up being shorter than 4 minutes, but still includes contrasting sections. In addition the sounds would be rudimentary, but utilized well. Delay would probably be included, but I understand reverb is harder to code so it may not make the cut. This, and every following outcome, assume the music sounds good.

# The Better Ending
The better ending would be if the piece was 4 minutes long, with sounds and synthesizer systems I was able to carefully design. Delay would again be utilized here, and reverb would be as well. The piece here would also be roughly mixed, to give it a good coat of polish before presentation.

# The Best Ending
An ideal outcome for this project will be a song totaling the aforementioned length, with effects processing and great sound design elements. I would have the skills necessary to live code the song during my final presentation slot, and do so. The song will also be well mixed. A visualizer would also be incorporated.

# Next Steps
I'm going to need to do a lot of research on Supercollider, and live coding for music in general. I have a baseline level of musical code from my prior taken Max class, but I'm unsure how well this will really transfer. I'll need to research how to make reverbs specifically, as well as Supercolliders own sound sources, and their parameters. I'll also need to do further research to determine how specific I can get with the creation of my audio effects/sound design.

# Three Resources I'll Use
I'll be using: The Rachel Rome Supercollider Repository, the Supercollider Book listed on the website, and several video series' in conjunction with my peers knowledge in the software (as well as youtube performances of live coding technique and more specific facets of the Supercollider language).
