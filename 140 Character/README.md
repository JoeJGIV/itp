## What I Did/Goal
I fell in love Nathaniel Virgo's headcube 2 code, so I sought to create my own version of his. I sort of succeeded, but I would've liked for my end result to look more different than his than it does now.

## How I Did it
Firstly I read through all of the analysis of the example tweets provided. From there I then tried to make my own code that utilized Duty to sample LFNoise, but I couldn't figure out how to quantize the noise, let alone in 140 characters. I then sought to recreate the generative idea, but with my own timbres/for future ambient uses. I found that using Dxrand would result in chords rather than a random melody, I'm still unsure as to why this is.

## Problems/Overcoming Odds
Firstly I ran into the chord cluster instead of a melody issue, this was fixed by changing to a Dseq instead of Drand or Dxrand.
Next I tried to add in some delay modulation, but I ran out of space to make the patch stereo. This is my favorite code in the file, but I had to remove the modulation to make it stereo for the final version.

## Final Notes
Overall this exercise was great, but I do wish my code was a little more unique, but following Nathaniel's example did help me to learn about adverbs and methods. I feel that the next, unlimited character patches I create will be able to be more in depth thanks to these new concepts that I will be asking you more about in class tomorrow.
