### Pyramid
This prompt was really challanging for me to code, I had to watch a few youtube videos re-explaining for loops (no code used from elsewhere), but I think I have a grasp on them now. It was defintely helpful in helping me realize the specifcity of code and usefulness of psuedo coding.

It was easy to ask the user for an integer input and creating an if statement that halted the program if this was greater than 8, while also naming this input "stacks"
I then began floundering for a while, eventually breaking down the process into psuedo code in my notebook.
1. Print amount of spaces minus stack number
2. Print number of hash equal to iteration
3. New line
4. Print one less space and one more hash for each iteration
After this I just had to stumble through syntax and indentation errors, evenutally squashing all my bugs

### FizzBuzz
This prompt was pretty straighforward. I easily got my program to list out numbers 1 - 100.
Adding in the Fizz and Buzz and FizzBuzz with modulo if statements and truthiness was self explanitory. Print if a number is divisible (remainder 0) 3, but NOT 5, etc
My only challange was getting the program to not list the numbers that fell into and Fizz Buzz category.
After a few minutes I realized I needed another if statement stating: if the number wasn't divisible by either its okay to print.
