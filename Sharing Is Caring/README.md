## Piece instructions
1. Add reverb and delay synths to the server
2. Add both effect's bus assignments
3. Add both to the server tree
4. CMD Period to ensure effects are in place (There should be 4 synths when you do this)
5. Add each synth to the server: magikarplus, drum, and bracelets
6. Add each pattern to the server: karplus, karplus 2, bongo, perc, brace part 1, and brace arp.
NOTE: all patterns have play and stop lines below them, this is simply for testing ease when adjusting patterns (It's encouraged users experiment and improvise with the patterns if they desire)
7. Scroll to the bottom of the code and play/stop the patterns at will! Improvisation is the crux of this piece and the loops will all play together nicely.
The pattern play/stop lines are the roughly intended order of addition (all are designed to be able to play at once), but users may vary the order as they like
8. Have fun! This code is as much an instrument as it is a piece.


## Typical Markdown notes for Rachel :)

## What went right
Overall I was able to use my new knowledge from the semester to create synths with more depth to them. I was able to comfortably incorporate math operators into some for example. I also completed my main goal in the creation of this piece: to make something that sounds good in supercollider, and not just like a coding proof of concept.

## What went wrong
My main hurdles were in the creation of my karplus voice, I wanted to use two delays if possible for stereoization, but quickly ran into memory issues when implementing this so I decided to forego the second delay. I remained worried about memory consumption during the making of the rest of my piece, but I didn't run into any more issues with it thankfully.

## What I learned
I learned even more about supercollider and how to utilize it's modeling object klank. I also dove deeper into making dynamic sounds with the software through adding LFO variables and such. I also was able to make my first karplus strong synth! Overall delving into physical modelling with the software was a treat, and I was able to make a piece I'm really proud of that should be fun for all to play.
